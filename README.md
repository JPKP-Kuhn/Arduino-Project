# Arduino-Project
### Arduino UNO
This is the final activitie from a rbotic introdution course. It's about two semaphore working together at the same time. For this I've used a little of **millis()** function.
The times in the code were divided by 10 for faster simulation while the pdf says 10 seconds, 30 so on.
